Possible X-MAS patterns:

M.M
.A.
S.S

M.S
.A.
M.S

S.S
.A.
M.M

S.M
.A.
S.M

A is always in the middle. Starting at top left, then top right,
then bottom left and then bottom right we have the following patterns
that give us a two MAS in the shape of an X:

MMSS, MSMS, SSMM, SSMM

So we can process our array by checking each entry: if it is an A,
then we proceed to check the corners in the order described above.
If the pattern we find is one of four patterns above, we increase
the counter.
