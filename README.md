# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges in Advent of Code 2024. See
[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/). I will post my solutions here but not the problem descriptions
themselves because of copyright / intellectual property concerns. However, with each solution I will post a link to the
problem description on the Advent of Code site, so it's easy to look up.

I use TypeScript as my programming language for the challenges. Specifically, I use [Deno](https://deno.com/), the
open-source TypeScript and JavaScript runtime for the modern web (yes, yes, the description is taken literally from the
Deno website). I love programming with Deno and all the functionality it provides: the Advent of Code is a nice
opportunity to use it.
